                    <p>In this picture, I am doing my work at the PDP IT Academy in Tashkent.
                        It was at this time that I was preparing my website, if I am not mistaken.
                        And I also want to mention that I‚Äôve learned what I‚Äôve read here,
                        and I haven‚Äôt stopped learning yet. I express my gratitude to the PDP.
